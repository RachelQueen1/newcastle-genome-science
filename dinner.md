Located in the heart of Bristol, Bristol Harbour Hotel fuses two iconic former bank properties to offer a spectacular event space, right in the heart of the city. Designed by renowned architect William Bruce Gingell the Hotel is converted from the previous Lloyds Bank building, inspired by Sansovinoâ€™s 16th century Venetian Library.

We will be dining in the Sansovino: a grand former banking hall now serving as an impressive event space offering beautiful historical details and a magnificent sky light, providing a stunning backdrop for Genome Science in the heart of the city.
