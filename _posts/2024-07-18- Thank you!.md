Thank you all for attending Genome Science 2024 at the University of Bristol. Your presence contributed to three days of excellent science, discussion, and networking with 200 other delegates, speakers, and sponsors from over 65 separate institutions. Special thanks to those delegates who traveled from outside of the UK to attend!

If you would like to contact someone about their presentation or poster, please see the abstract booklet - https://bristol.genomescience.org.uk/info_and_abstracts/

Huge thanks to Lia Chappell for the group photo. It can be found at https://bristol.genomescience.org.uk/group-photo/

We are hoping to be able to announce the location of Genome Science 2025 over the coming months and we would be thrilled if you were able to join us next year.
