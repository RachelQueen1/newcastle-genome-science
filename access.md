# Accessibility Support

### Venues

The conference and dinner venues are accessibility friendly. If you have any particular needs please contact the conference organisers ahead of time so that we can accommodate you

### Accommodation – Accessibility Subsidy

We are happy to be able to offer accessible-friendly rooms at the same rate as our cheapest University-run accommodation (£50 per night). Please contact us if you have accessibility needs and we will organise an accessible room to suite your needs in a location convenient for travel to the conference venue.
